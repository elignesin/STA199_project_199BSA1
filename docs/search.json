    "title": "The Power of Investment: The Spatial Variation of Racially Discriminatory Redlining Throughout the United States",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It has long been established that redlining, the practice of classifying neighborhoods as hazardous to investment, primarily targets neighborhoods that predominantly have nonwhite residents (Aaronson et al. 2021). Given the role that historic redlining has played in shaping modern day urban America, its socioeconomic impacts have frequently been studied (Appel 2016). However, redlining was heterogeneously distributed across various regions of the United States, thus creating a regional disparity in social mobility (Xu 2023). These hazard zones, created by the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) are classified with the alphabetical letters A, B, C, and D, with increasing levels of risk. Zones assigned A and B are considered less risky to invest in than zones C and D.\nTo further pursue this inquiry, this study seeks to identify drivers of differences in the prevalence of redlining. Do the proportions of nonwhite residents living in formerly low-ranked (levels C and D) HOLC zones differ regionally across the United States? To explore an alternative driver of racial disparity across HOLC zone, we inquire, do the proportions of nonwhite residents living in formerly low-ranked HOLC zones differ based on the size of the metropolitan area as a whole? In other words, was redlining more pronounced in large metropolises compared to mid-sized cities? Our final line of inquiry pertains to the geographic distribution of ethnic groups within a metropolitan area. Is there a significant difference in the racial composition of a neighborhood encompassed by a low ranked HOLC zone compared to directly adjacent neighborhoods? This question assesses whether redlined areas were racially targeted on a microgeographic scale as opposed to merely reflecting larger demographic trends across the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as a whole.\nThese investigations can be summed up the following research question: How does region, metropolitan area size and geographic distribution of racial groups within a metropolitan area impact racial diversity in formerly redlined neighborhoods?\nIn the 1930s, America was in the midst of the Great Depression. In an attempt to jumpstart the private sector and reduce unemployment, the Roosevelt administration implemented the New Deal, a suite of public works projects and financial incentives. A part of the New Deal package was the National Housing Act of 1934, with established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) (Light 2010a). The FHA was designed to write loans to promote homeownership. To establish criteria to decide on which applicants would receive loans, the FHA asked the HOLC to create maps to determine the area which was the most desirable to loan to (Michney 2021). Most predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods were placed in zones C and D, making it difficult for residents in these zones to secure loans (Fishback et al. 2020). The HOLC maps were a major factor in whether families were able to achieve homeownership during the early 20th century, when suburban development made homeownership more attainable for a larger percentage of Americans (Logan et al. 2023). This is significant because homeownership is a generational source of wealth that can be passed on to descendants (Light 2010b). As a result, the demographic composition of neighborhoods classified by the HOLC has changed little since the maps were first created 90 years ago (An, Orlando, and Rodnyansky 2019).\nWe hypothesize that cities along the West Coast and in the Midwestern United States have a higher proportion of nonwhite residents living in HOLC zones C and D than cities on the East Coast. This hypothesis is due to the concurrent development of these cities with the implementation of the redlining policies, whereas East Coast had already been developed before redlining was implemented (Xu 2023). We also hypothesize that larger cities will see greater racial disparities across HOLC zones. This is based on findings indicating a positive relationship between wage inequality and city size (Baum-Snow and Pavan 2013). Our final hypothesis is that there will be a significant difference in ethnic composition between neighborhoods encompassed by zones C and D and directly adjacent neighborhoods. The premise of this assumption is evidence of structural racism in the real estate industry that influenced the creation of the HOLC maps (Wassmer 2023).\nGiven the unethical nature of discriminatory lending practices, it is important to consider the ethical considerations of working with this data. The data about race and ethnicity comes from the US Census in 2020. Research has shown that non-response bias and undercounting is higher among racial and ethnic minorities (Lor et al. 2017). Therefore, this may have resulted in an undercount of ethnic minorities in the redlined communities in the data set we are using. Additionally, using ‘redlined neighborhoods’ as a level of analysis risks cementing racial segregation in the HOLC zones as an analytic paradigm. However, we believe that these concerns can be mitigated by placing the data analysis within the appropriate historical context.\nOur motivation in doing this research was to try to understand the sources and spatial extent of inequality. We felt that redlining was a topic that encompassed our diverse interests of geography, politics, urban planning and health equity. We hope to understand how redlining impacts these fields today.\nThe data was compiled by the statistics and news website FiveThirtyEight. The data can be downloaded off the FiveThirtyEight website (2022). FiveThirtyEight has also created a GitHub repository for the data which includes a description of the variables. The data about the redlining zones was taken from the Mapping Inequality Project, which collected the data by analyzing the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps produced between 1935 and 1940. The data of race and ethnicity was taken from the 2020 U.S. Census. The modern-day census data was matched to the historic HOLC zones by determining which blocks overlapped with HOLC zones and calculating the percentage of the block’s area that intersected with the HOLC zone. The proportion of the block intersecting with the HOLC zone was used to weigh each block’s demographic data when summing the estimated 2020 population of the historic HOLC zones. The dataset contains 28 unique columns and 551 observations. Most of the columns give the number of residents belonging to each racial group within a HOLC zone. There are also columns indicating the total population of the HOLC zone, percentage of each racial group in a HOLC zone and the populations and percentages of ethnic groups across an entire metropolitan area’s HOLC zones. These observations are quantitative, including both raw numbers and percentages. There is also a column representing HOLC zone, which is categorical with the categories being the four HOLC zones. The HOLC zone levels are ordinal. Additionally, we modified the data set to create news variables for region, which groups metropolitan areas by their region to test variations across regions and difference in white population, which quantifies the difference in proportion of white residents in between an HOLC zone ranked C and D and the directly adjacent zone (regardless of zone quality). We chose to define regions based on the United States Census Bureau classification of the United States into four regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West."

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we calculate the proportion of racial groups in the lowest HOLC zones by state. In doing so, we can compare population percentages by race across regions to see which region had the greatest amount of redlining. In other words, this graph shows which states have the highest number of non-white residents clustered in low HOLC zones (zones C and D). States in the deep South and urban Northeast have the greatest percentage of non-white residents in low HOLC zones. We chose to use a map of the United States in order to visualize the population of non-white people across the whole nation. By doing this we can get a snapshot of the entire country and visualize how zones C and D compare across states.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo investigate the general racial trends of redlining across the United States, we created a visualization that displays the proportion of the population that is non-white in each of the HOLC Grades and faceted by the major regions of the United States (composed of the Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). Each region follows a similar trend in which there is a clear inverse correlation between the quality of HOLC grade (A being the highest, D being the lowest) and the percent of non-white people in the population. The percentage of non-white people in the population increases as the quality of the zone decreases, with the highest proportion of nonwhite people in D zones and the lowest in A zones. In all of the regions, grade A zones have a median non-white population of about 25%, grade B zone medians hover around 37.5%, grade C zone medians are less regular across the regions but are still in line with the general trend, and grade D zone medians are all above a 50% non-white population, following the general trend.\nWe opted to use a box plot for this visualization because we are working with a categorical variable and a quantitative variable. Using a boxplot also allowed us to facet by region with the result being easily visually interpreted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure focuses on El Paso, Texas, the city with the greatest proportion of non-white residents (96.23%) in zone D of the metropolitan areas represented in the data set across HOLC zones. In this visualization, we can see that the trend of inverse relationship between white population and quality of HOLC zone is still followed for the most part when in areas where white people do not compose the majority of the population. This piece of data also demonstrates that redlining is not simply the segregation of Black and white people. This figure demonstrates that in El Paso, the population is overwhelmingly Hispanic with both Asian people and Black people making up very small (less than 5%) of the population. This graph can be compared with the Durham-Chapel Hill racial breakdown in Figure 4.\nWe chose to use a relative frequency bar graph for this figure because we are comparing different demographic breakdowns across a qualitative variable. By using this visualization it is easy to see what proportion of each zone each race makes up within El Paso.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure visualizes the racial population of Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina. There is an adherence to the trend of a larger proportional population of white people in areas with higher HOLC grade. This demonstrates that even in areas with more variation in racial makeup, there is still a clear presence of the correlation between lower HOLC grade and a higher percent non-white population. In zone A, white people make up over 75% of the population. In zone B it’s about 65% white; zone C is about 40% white; zone D is about 16% white. As the quality of zone decreases, there is an increase in percent of both Hispanic and Black residents. The percent of Asian residents in the population remains low across all zones and remains constant at less than 5% of the population, with a slightly larger population in zone C."

In the linear models, the percentage of non-white residents in zones C and D was the response variable. This served as a measure of modern day segregation in formerly redlined areas. In the logistic models, the zone quality, which was grouped into ‘high’ (zones A and B) and ‘low’ (zones C and D) zones, was the response variables. While this response still measured racial segregation, it did so in a different way by looking across all four zones as opposed to focusing on the lower-ranked zones.

For linear model selection, the adjusted r squared and AIC values were predominantly complementary as complexity increased, though conflicted across equivalent additive and interactive 3-variable multiple linear regressions. We erred on the side of consistency and prioritized the improved AIC value over the slight dissonance where the selected linear model has a lower adjusted r squared value than an alternative model."

    "text": "Redlining, a discriminatory lending practice which prevented many minority communities from receiving federal loans, has left a legacy of racial segregation, with formerly redlined neighborhoods being among the most segregated areas in the United States in 2020. Using two models, one that predicts the percentage of non-white residents in a zone and another that predicts the zone level, we analyze what factors are most likely to contribute to segregation in historically redlined regions. The results suggest that the difference in the proportion in white residents between the formerly redlined neighborhood and the directly adjacent areas is the strongest predictor of racial segregation. To solidify this result, we conducted a two-sided hypothesis test, which produced a p-value significant at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level, confirming a statistically significant difference in racial composition. This research demonstrates the importance of choosing small spatial scales when conducting inequality research to avoid the ecological fallacy, where the aggregation of data masks distinct patterns at lower levels of analysis. Thus, policymakers need to consider targeting specific blocks and neighborhoods as opposed to zip codes when implementing economic development initiatives."

This set is on their website and is data collected on arrests in the city from 2010 to 2019: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Drug-Possession-Arrest-Data-By-Race/x4fz-zcf7\nData Collection: This data was collected from 2010 through 2019 by the Los Angeles Police Department. It is transcribed from original arrest reports which were then typed on paper. \nOverview of Observations: Each observation is an individual’s arrest for drug possession. There are 16 variables and 1.24 million observations, we are only looking at the rows from 2019, of which there are 25,174. For each observation there are variables that cover when and where the arrest was made, information about the person being arrested such as their age, gender, and race, there’s also columns which cover information about why the arrest was made such as the charge and charge description."

    "text": "Research question\n\nQuestion: In Los Angeles city, within 2019, is there a correlation between the initial crime that a person is charged with (curfew violation, open container, battery, etc) and the arrest for drug possession? Do we see more people of certain races or genders charged more often with certain crimes? \nResearch Topic: The research topic would focus on the racial and gender demographics of drug arrests and look at what kind of situations (initial charges) often have a correlation with drug possession or the pursuit of a drug-related arrest. Our hypothesis is that non white men are the most likely to be arrested for drug possession. We think that these arrests are most likely to be paired with charges related to past experiences with the justice system such as breaking curfew and probation/parole terms. \nVariables: The variables will be mostly nominal categorical variables: Sex code, Descent Code, Charge Group Description, and Charge Description. We may also look at the Age variable which is ordinal quantitative."

It explores the race of who gets arrested most and where. The article finds that officers chose to use higher rates of surveillance in black neighborhoods. The article asserts that police cite “suspicion of Black citizens’ ambiguous demeanor and the area’s crime problems” to then initiate stop and frisks more often than for white people and in neighborhoods white people are more likely to frequent. This leads to disproportionate rates of Black people being arrested for drugs when it’s known that Black and white people use drugs at similar levels. Because of systemic racism in policing, Black people are also more likely to have outstanding bench warrants which increase their risk for arrest during drug stops.\nContribution of Research Question: This article focuses on how the location (white neighborhood or not) of the arrest may impact the decision-making of the police officer to further instigate an arrest. Our question explores the arrests from another (related) angle of whether there’s correlation between the initial reason for interaction/charge and being arrested for drugs. These reasons may vary based on the location of the interaction but that is not exactly what our project is focusing on."

It explains that those with no high school education have the highest risk of developing diabetes, as compared to those who did not finish high school and those that have an education greater than the high school level. It further explains that poor people in poor neighborhoods have the highest risk of developing diabetes, and further clarifies these risks by race. It also investigates food environment, environmental risk factors, and social context. It then provides data to demonstrate the linkages of the health care system on social determinants of health.\nContribution of Research Question: It provides a very in-depth review of the many different factors included in social determinants of health that are undoubtedly included in our data’s social vulnerability index (SVI). It gives background and information relevant to our data’s topic, letting us link it to healthcare information."
